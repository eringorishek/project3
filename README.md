For the housing price factor, the image bellow is showing the change in price over 2020-2023. The scale for this map is: darker the area = is the biggest difference in price, and then the lighter the area = the least amount of change in pricing. 

When looking at all three images, we can conclude that gentrification is happening in Austin, Tx. The definition of gentrification is: the process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses, typically displacing current inhabitants in the process. When we compare the zip codes with lower incomes and the zip codes that have he biggest change in housing prices, many of these zip codes are the same. Concluding that gentrification is happening in these zip codes.
